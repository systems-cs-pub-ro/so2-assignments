Makefile.checker
	* Makefile for automating the build process

_checker
	* script to run all tests defined in _test/test.c

_test/test.c
	* test suite for software RAID

== BUILDING ==

Use the Makefile to properly build the run-test executable:

	make -f Makefile.checker

== RUNNING ==

Copy your ssr.ko module and _checker and run-test
to fsimg/root directory on your QEMU/KVM virtual machine.

In order to run the test suite you can either use the _checker
script or run the run-test executable.

The _checker script runs all tests and computes assignment grade:

	./_checker

In order to run a specific test pass the test number (1 .. 78) to the
run-test executable.

	./run-test 5
